	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. Analyzing time complexity helps in designing efficient algorithms that perform well for large inputs.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to its input size. It is often expressed in terms of O(n), where n represents the size of the input data.</p>
